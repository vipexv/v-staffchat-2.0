Hellooo, i’ve been getting allot of messages recently about the my old staff chat script which was released a bit ago, it’s been outdated for a little bit now, and it has been needing a re-work, especially with my Tech Stack & Skills having changed and improved allot over the time period, so i wanted to go ahead and just make a new version for the people still interested.

None of the code is being re-used, this is completely new and a huge improvement in every aspect.

**[Script Information]**
1. Performance: Runs at 0.00 Resmon (Client).
2. Completely standalone meaning no other dependencies required.
3. If you would like to contribute, please go ahead and head over to the GitHub page and feel free to send a pull request.
